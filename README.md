# Hard vs. Soft Viterbi Decoding for Convolutional Codes

This MATLAB project simulates and analyzes the performance of convolutional codes using both **Hard Decision Decoding (HDD)** and **Soft Decision Decoding (SDD)** techniques over an **AWGN** channel with **BPSK modulation**.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

- Simulates convolutional encoding with different generator matrices and constraint lengths.
- Compares bit error rates (BER) of HDD vs. SDD over varying SNR (Eb/N0) levels.
- Evaluates decoding performance for:
  - Code 1: r = 1/2, Kc = 3  
  - Code 2: r = 1/3, Kc = 4  
  - Code 3: r = 1/3, Kc = 6
