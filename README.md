# Hard vs. Soft Viterbi Decoding for Convolutional Codes

This MATLAB project simulates and compares **Hard Decision Decoding (HDD)** and **Soft Decision Decoding (SDD)** for convolutional codes over an **AWGN** channel using **BPSK modulation**.

## ðŸ§  Overview

- Simulates convolutional encoding and decoding using Viterbi algorithm.
- Evaluates BER for both hard and soft decoding over varying Eb/N0 (SNR) values.
- Codes tested:
  - r = 1/2, Kc = 3  
  - r = 1/3, Kc = 4  
  - r = 1/3, Kc = 6
- Includes both **simulation** and **theoretical** BER curves.

## ðŸ§ª How to Run

1. Open `viterbi_decoder.m` in MATLAB or Octave.
2. Run the script â€” it will:
   - Simulate encoding/decoding
   - Add AWGN noise
   - Compute and plot BER for all 3 configurations

---

## ðŸ“Š Output

The script generates BER vs. Eb/N0 plots comparing:
- Theoretical BER
- Hard Decision BER
- Soft Decision BER
